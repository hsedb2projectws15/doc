\section{Mission Objectives}
\subsection{Structuring}
Data will be stored in a manner that reduces the possibility of conflicts. The stored data
will contain information about lecturers, lectures, rooms and times. Possible restrictions
will be honored.

Example: If lecture A can only be held in room B at time C for Semester D this will be the only valid combination.

\subsection{Querying / Reporting}
The database can be queried for different kinds of information and is able to generate reports.

Example: The administrator can search for faculty, lecturers, rooms, times, departments and more.

\subsection{Update}
The database will accept updates if they are correct and do not violate any process rules. Otherwise the database
will not accept the data.

Example: If the administrator wants to put Prof. X at room Y at time Z, but has placed Prof. A there at the same
time, this query will yield an error.
