\section{Mission Objectives}
\subsection{Structuring}

Data will be stored in a manner that reduces the possibility of
inconsistencies. The stored data will contain information about lecturers,
lectures and times. Possible restrictions will be honored.

Example: %\TODO 

\subsection{Querying / Reporting}

The database can be queried for different kinds of information and is able to
generate the reports specified by the client.

Example: The administrator can search for faculty, lecturers, times,
departments and more.

\subsection{Update}

The database will accept updates if they are correct and do not violate any
process rules. Otherwise the database will not accept the data.

Example: If a restriction puts a lecture at midnight, the restriction would
violate the working hours of the university and therefore will result in an
error.

\subsection{Documentation}

A report of work planned for specific lecturers over a given time frame can be
generated.

Example: The administrator wants to know what Prof X did in summer 2010.
